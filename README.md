# hello-world
This is a test so I can get more familiarized with GitHub

I'm following the GitHub Tutorial. Unfortunately, I have already failed as I was editing the "README" file in the master branch.

I had the opportunity to see my mistake before I commited changes. So this is the good way to do it!
